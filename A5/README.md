**Group 42 - Assignment A5** 

**Group reflections as a manager group:** 

As a manager group we decided to both do the tool and continue to help the other groups with developing their tools, tutorials and facilitating their feedback to each other. It was interesting helping the other groups as we also learned a lot with problem solving and figuring out the specific issues for each group. Lucikly the build team was small, so it was really easy to collaborate on the issues that overlapped which conveniently were most of them. Our own tool tried to take a more holistic scope and we tried to develop something that could help the analysts, which worked to a certain degree.

*Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?*

Probably not, but I will keep some of the stuff we have learned about information sharing and open access in mind

*Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?*

I think there is a decent chance that I could use it later in life but it very much depends on what type of work I end up doing. 

*Conclude the journey through A1-A5:*

It was definetly interesting, the course is very open-ended and that can be very intimidating when first starting out. I think some of the tools and objectives of the course could have been more thorougly explained and there could have been more "hand-holding" during the first couple of weeks of the course. The manager groups could also have been much clearer defined especially before a group has to say they want to be managers. Make the assignments differentiate between managers and analysts so that everyone knows ehat they are supposed to be doing.

*Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?*

The reason i chose this course was becasue of my interest in programing/optimation aspect of OpenBIM, so the door is open for it to play a big part in my thesis.

*Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?*

Yes, i would say so, i have a development assignment where OpenBIM can come in play. I hope to get more assignments like this. 

*Conclude the journey through A1-A5:*

Being part of the manager group was initially a challenging experience, as the expectations and responsibilities were unclear. However, over time, the role became more defined. The manager group evolved into a vital support unit, assisting the analyst groups by addressing their questions and guiding them toward solutions. This process required us to deepen our understanding of various tools and objectives, enabling us to provide effective support. While unconventional, this hands-on approach proved to be an efficient and impactful method of learning, ultimately strengthening our ability to fulfill our responsibilities.
