**About the Tool: **

**State the problem/claim that your tool is solving:**

Knowing an estimate of your project's cost at any stage is essential for effective budget management. When you have an idea of the costs upfront, it allows you to make informed decisions about resource allocation, identify potential financial risks early, and make adjustments before expenses spiral out of control. With accurate cost estimates, you can assess whether the project is tracking towards its financial goals and whether youâ€™re staying within budget constraints. This tool helps make rough estimates during the design phase.
