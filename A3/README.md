**About the Tool:**

**State the problem/claim that your tool is solving:**

Knowing an estimate of your project's cost at any stage is essential for effective budget management. When you have an idea of the costs upfront, it allows you to make informed decisions about resource allocation, identify potential financial risks early, and make adjustments before expenses spiral out of control. With accurate cost estimates, you can assess whether the project is tracking towards its financial goals and whether youâ€™re staying within budget constraints. This tool helps make rough estimates during the design phase. 

**State where you found that problem:**

The problem was not found directly in the IFC-files but is a general problem when it comes to project management. Many larger building projects in the later years has had issues with keeping to budgets and this tool can help eliveate some of those issues

**Description of the tool:**

**Instructions to run the tool:**

**Advanced Building Design:** 

**What Advanced Building Design Stage (A, B, C or D) would your tool be useful?**

**Which subjects might use it?** 

The tool could be use full for both consulting and contracting firms. For the consulting firms it can be use to make a more precises price estimate for the projekt porposal when the bim model is more or less finished. The consulting firm can also be used to confirm a contracters bid, before accepting it. 
The contracters could use it in the same way, when giving a bid for a potential construction, a lot of time would be saved if they could run the program, instead of having to count every single element in a drawing or model. 

**What information is required in the model for your tool to work?** 

The model needs both database and an IFC file with needed meassurements, for a concrete beam it could be the length, a wall it would be the total m2. If the tool is utilized by a consulting firm, it would be very benificial for the department of BIM-analyst to co-ordinate with the projekt leaders to make a standard for the IFC classifications.
