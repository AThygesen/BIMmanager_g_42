Group 42 - Assignment A2

A2a: About your Group

Confidence in Python: 
3

Focus Area:
Build

Manager or Analyst: 
Manager

A2b: Identify Claim
As the manager group, our claim is based on the choices of our analyst groups. They have all chosen to test claims that have to do with cost. To connect all groups, this group has also chosen to work with cost and will try to utilize the analyst groups script for our own claim

The three analyst groups are checking facades, glass facades and concrete columns.

1. Select which building(s) to focus on for your focus area:
Building #2406: This building has detailed cost data available in the reports, including Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis and materials like facades, glass facades, and concrete columns, which are relevant to the claim.

2. Identify a claim to check from one of those reports: 
Based on the data collected by the analyst groups, we will try to check the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for building #2406. The claim is found on page 6 in the appendix of CES_BLD_24_06_PM_Appendix. 

3. Write a short description of the claim you wish to check:
The claim focuses on evaluating the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of key building components, specifically facades, glass facades, and concrete columns, to determine the most cost-efficient design for long-term operation and maintenance. The aim is to quantify the total LCC over the building's 50-year lifespan.

4. Justify the selection of the claim
This claim was selected because it integrates data from multiple areas of the project, which are the focus of three separate analyst groups. By evaluating the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of these components, we can connect their work and provide a comprehensive analysis of the building's long-term financial efficiency. Additionally, LCC is a critical metric in sustainable building design, as it accounts for both initial construction costs and ongoing operational and maintenance costs, making it a valuable claim to test.

A2c: Use Case

1. How would you check this claim
Use BIM software to extract the quantities and cost data
Input this data into a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) calculation model
Check if costs are the same as stated in the report. 

2. When would this claim need to be checked?
This claim needs to be checked during the Design Phase of the project. This is because the LCC analysis influences material selection and design decisions. Checking the claim early in the design process allows for adjustments that could optimize long-term cost efficiency before construction begins.

3. What information does this claim rely on?
Cost Data: Initial construction costs, operational costs, and maintenance costs for facades, glass facades, and concrete columns.

4. What phase is this claim relevant to?
Phase: Design

The claim is checked in the Design Phase since the choice of materials is finalized here, affecting both construction and long-term operational costs.

5. What BIM purpose is required?
BIM Purpose: Analyse

The purpose here is to analyze data related to material costs, operational efficiency, and maintenance schedules in order to evaluate long-term financial impact.

A2e: Tool Idea

1. Describe in words your idea for your own OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool in Python
Having a tool that can help extract and sort wide ranges of data is a time saver for both IKT leader and the engineer during the cost calculations. This tool is not meant to do the work for the individual, it is meant to assist, so the individual only need to focus on the data and not the gathering of set data.

2. What is the business and societal value of your tool?
The time saved can significantly reduce the number of hours the engineer needs to spend on gathering data, freeing up additional hours. This could enable the company to offer a lower price for the tender, increasing its chances of winning more projects. Another way our tool can have an impact is during the quality assurance, with the tool being somewhat automatic.
