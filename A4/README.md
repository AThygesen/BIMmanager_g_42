**Group 42 - Assignment 4**

Manager Group:
We helped facilitate the feedback and tutorial process and made sure the feedback was written down and given out to the other groups. 

**Feedback Tutorial:**

**Group 40:**

Feedback from Group 44:

I like that you get the output in a table form, that makes is really structured

Question: Your code were able to identify different types of doors? 

Feedback from Group 41:

Question: How is your tutorial formatted?

Feedback from Group 42:

Really good idea to use regex

Entrepeneurs can use it in a tendor phase

Great table output

For future purposes: See if the script is able to do it with windows to see if it is adaptable and interchangable. The potential for    that is very cool


**Group 44:**

Feedback from Group 40:

Question: When you get the volume is it based on the dimensions? 

Answer: It is based on the volumes in the IFC-files 

Feedback from Group 41:

Cool that you solved the volume extraction problems 

Feedback from Group 42: 

You made a great phase breakdown

Cool that is it interchangable with the fact that you could use it for beams and other elements with the same code	

**Group 41:**
	
 Feedback from Group 40: 

 Question: Is it the user that inserts the cost?

 Sounds like a good tool to use

 Answer: Cost is a variable that we inserted in the definition 

 Feedback from Group 44: 

 Question: What if the type is not m^2? 

 Answer: You can adapt the script to fit something like volume, but you would need to.

 That is a point for development

 Good job

 Feedback from Group 42: 

 Question: Have you thought about what phase the tool could be used?

 The tool is very manual, since you have to modify the code to make it fit. 

 Maybe make the search phrase a part of the input so that is it more fluent. 

 You thought about the use-phases very well
