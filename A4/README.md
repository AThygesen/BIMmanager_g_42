**Group 42 - Assignment 4**

Manager Group:
We helped facilitate the feedback and tutorial process and made sure the feedback was written down and given out to the other groups. 

**Group 40:**

Feedback from Group 44:

I like that you get the output in a table form, that makes is really structured

Question: Your code were able to identify different types of doors? 

Feedback from Group 41:

Question: How is your tutorial formatted?

Feedback from Group 42:

Really good idea to use regex

Entrepeneurs can use it in a tendor phase

Great table output

For future purposes: See if the script is able to do it with windows to see if it is adaptable 	and interchangable. The potential for    that is very cool


**Group 44:**

Feedback from Group 40:

Question: When you get the volume is it based on the dimensions? 

Answer: It is based on the volumes in the IFC-files 

Feedback from Group 41:

Cool that you solved the volume extraction problems 

Feedback from Group 42: 

You made a great phase breakdown

Cool that is it interchangable with the fact that you could use it for beams and other elements with the same code
